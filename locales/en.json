    "p1": "At first I had a big desire to write an outstanding autobiography but unfortunately after several unsuccessful attempts I gave up.  Nevertheless I decided to start with a small step and I am going add short stories about me from time to time. Please don't judge me too harshly it is my first attempt to tell publicly about myself.",
	"p2": "In the first place I would like to tell you about the main reason, which encouraged me to write these lines. In a nutshell I challenged myself. In my childhood studying at school I had difficulties in literature and humanities in the whole. Reading was not my thing in those days. The only exception was perhaps technical literature: math exercises, stories about math and etc. In junior classes in speed reading I always had D and besides I made many mistakes in writing. But in high school having matured and rethinked some aspects of the life I started to read more and more books and things have started to get better. Of course having finished school I didn't feel that I can write quite an understandable text. But last years at school I was passionate about reading and that was not bad at all. And now, many years later, when it's time to grow up I would like to try my skills at the art of writing.",
