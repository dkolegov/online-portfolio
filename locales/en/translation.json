But I decided to start with a small step and I am going add short stories about me from time to time. Please don't judge me too harshly it is my first attempt to tell about myself.(28.12.2015)",
	"p2": "At first I would like to tell you about main reason, which encouraged me to write these lines. In a nutshell I challenged myself. In childhood studying at school I had difficulties in literature and humanities in the whole. I didnâ€™t like to read what can I say. The only exception was perhaps math literature: math exercises, stories about math and etc. In junior classes in speed reading I always had D and besides I made many mistakes in writing. But in high school having matured and rethinked some aspects of the life I started to read more and more fiction books and things have started to get better. Of course having finished school I didn't feel that I can write to be understandable and nice to read. But last years at school I loved to read and that was not bad at all. And now, many years later, when it's time to grow up :) I would like to try my skills at the art of writing. (01.03.2016)",
